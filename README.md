### Prerequisites

  - Chrome: [install chromedriver.exe](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver#quick-installation)
  - Firefox: Coming soon...

### Installation

1. Install requirements

```
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Notes Before Running

1. Make sure to add chromedriver.exe in environment PATH
2. If you don't want to then specify chromedriver.exe's location before running: `python main.py --path=/path/to/chromedriver.exe`

### Notes While Running

The bot might needs your help when these below problems occur.

1. The bot sometime will try to attack far away enemies while ignore closer enemies.
2. There is a bug in the game that let the skill's execution time goes negative value and I try to take this into consideration. (don't worry, for the time being, the bot will reset itself if this happen.)

### What This Bot Can Do?

- During **attack mode**, the bot can switch between first attack skill and second attack skill if it have one.
- During **defend mode**, the bot can switch between first defend skill and second defend skill if it have one (_only turn on when bot's health is low_).
- The bot could perform **random moves**
- The bot can **find different enemy** if it's attack skills could not reach or damage the current enemy.
- The bot can **rest** for few seconds when its mana goes low.
- The bot can **automatically respawn** under the acceptance of the user.

### Running

```
    python main.py
```

Use the command below to turn on debug mode:

```
    python main.py -v
```
