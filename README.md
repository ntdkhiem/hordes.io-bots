2) If you don't want to then specify chromedriver.exe's location before running: `python main.py --path=/path/to/chromedriver.exe`

### Notes While Running 
The bot is still in beta mode so it needs your help everytime these below problems occur.
1) The bot sometime will try to attack far away enemies while ignore closer enemies.
2) There is a bug in the game that let the skill's execution time goes negative value and I try to take this into consideration. (don't worry, for the time being, the bot will reset itself if this happen.)

### What This Bot Can Do?
- During __attack mode__, the bot can switch between first attack skill and second attack skill if it have one.
- During __defend mode__, the bot can switch between first defend skill and second defend skill if it have one (_only turn on when bot's health is low_).
- The bot could perform __random moves__
- The bot can __find different enemy__ if it's attack skills could not reach or damage the current enemy.
- The bot can __rest__ for few seconds when its mana goes low.
- The bot can __automatically respawn__ under the acceptance of the user.

### Running
```
    python main.py
```
